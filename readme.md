### Here we chose the Bare workflow minimal template

```
Choose a template: Â» - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
    ----- Managed workflow -----
    blank               a minimal app as clean as an empty canvas
    blank (TypeScript)  same as blank but with TypeScript configuration
    tabs (TypeScript)   several example screens and tabs using react-navigation and TypeScript
    ----- Bare workflow -----
>  minimal             bare and minimal, just the essentials to get you started
```

## _Notice_

#### You'll notice the "Andorid" directory is changed to "Androids" with and added "S"

that's due to expo ignoring the app.json
file with the configurations for splash screen and icon if "Android" folder exists.

_Expo assumes that these configurations are written natively in the Android folder_
